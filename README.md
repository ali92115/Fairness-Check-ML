# Fairness-Check-ML
South German Credit Dataset check of fairness. I use 5 different models as an ensemble to calculate the accuracies of Logisitic Regression, Decision Trees, Gaussian Naive Bayes, 
Random Forest and XGBoost on the South German Credit Dataset. Then, I run a fairness metric test on them using the fairMLHealth library and write about my understanding and findings.
